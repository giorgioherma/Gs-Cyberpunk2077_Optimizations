# G's Cyberpunk 2077 Total Optimization Generator

**Status: documentation/foundation only — no unified application, REDscript optimization generator, combined installer or validated all-in-one package exists yet.**

One user-oriented Windows application for **CET/Lua profiling, REDscript profiling, optional CapFrameX frame measurements, unified analysis, and a single game-installable optimization ZIP**. The project's currently tested game target is Cyberpunk 2077 **2.31**. Do not use the game version or third-party mod versions as rigid source-hash admission criteria.

## The agreed product

**One game folder · Two pages · Three primary first-page actions · One ZIP.**

- **Page 1: Profiler.** `Install Profilers` → `Create Game Capture` → `Continue to Analytics & Pass Generation`. A complete, current capture unlocks continuation.
- **Page 2: Analytics & Pass Generation.** Automatically collect, safely restore temporary profiler components, analyze current installed sources, show a clear report, and enable `Generate Optimization ZIP` only for proven safe generation.
- Suggested capture: around five minutes of varied gameplay, **not** a forced timer. CapFrameX is optional.
- **Vortex overlay recommended.** The user retains their original mods. No profilers, reports, diagnostics, documents, or PDB files enter the optimization ZIP.

The old TOTAL Profiler is **historical reference only**, not a migration binary baseline.
